# <Code-Quiz-Game>

## Description
This game is a short quiz of random questions just to get your brain going!  Please hit the start button to begin the quiz and simply select an answer choice to make a selection and move onto the next question.  At the end, the score and name used in the beginning will be saved and stored in localStorage.  If you miss a question, the timer will subtract by 10 seconds and you will lose a point.  More will be added in the future! This game was  built using Vanilla JS and taught me how to start thinking stratgetically on how to start writing code in my future projects. Enjoy!
